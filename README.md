# QUOTE_PROJECT  

# 📌 Project 1 : Quote Fetcher  
This is my **first Python project** where I tried to build something simple but useful.  
The idea was to fetch random quotes from an online API and display them in the terminal.  

---

## 🚀 What this project does  
- Connects to a free quotes API (`https://api.quotable.io/random`)  
- Shows a random **quote** and the **author**  
- If the internet or API fails, it will not crash but instead show a **backup (fallback) quote**  
- Also tested different error cases (wrong URL, wrong keys, etc.)  

---

## 🛠️ What I used  
- Python (basic level)  
- `requests` library to call the API  
- `random` library for choosing fallback quotes  

---

## 📷 Sample Output  
💬 The expert in anything was once a beginner.
✍️ - Helen Hayes 

--- 

And if the API fails:  
⚠️ API unavailable, showing fallback quote :
💬 Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.
✍️ - Suzy Kassem

## 🎯 Why I made this  
This project was mainly for **practice and learning**:  
- How to use APIs in Python  
- How to handle errors (so the program doesn’t just break)  
- How to add a simple fallback mechanism  

---

## 🙌 Future Ideas  
- Maybe add multiple quotes at once  
- Show motivational quotes daily (like a small console app)  

---

## 📖 Note  
This is a **beginner project**, done as part of my Python learning journey.  
It’s not perfect, but it’s the **first step towards bigger projects** 🚀
